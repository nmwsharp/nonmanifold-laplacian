//
// This could be done robustly via e.g. Shewchuk's triangle.c. However, instead we use a simple self-contained strategy
// which leverages the needs of this particular situation. In particular, we don't really care about getting exactly the
// Delaunay triangulation; we're just looking for any sane triangulation to use as input the the subsequent step. We
// just use Delaunay because we like the property that (in the limit of sampling), it's a triple-cover of the domain;
// with other strategies it's hard to quantify how many times our triangles cover the domain. This makes the problem
// easier, because for degenerate/underdetermined cases, we're happy to output any triangulation, even if it's not the
// Delaunay triangulation in exact arithmetic.
//
// This strategy works by angularly sorting points relative to the neighborhood center, then walking around circle
// identifying pairs of edges which form Delaunay triangles (more details inline). In particular, using a sorting of the
// points helps to distinguish indeterminate cases and always output some triangles. Additionally, a few heuristics are
// included for handling of degenerate and collinear points. This routine has O(n*k^2) complexity, where k is the
// neighborhood size).
